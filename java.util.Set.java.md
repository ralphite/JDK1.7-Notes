----------

- No duplicate elements

> Great care must be taken care of if mutable objects are used
as set elements. If an element is changed in a manner that affects
equals comparison, then the behavior of the set is not specified.

..

> A set cannot contain itself.

The Set interface has the same methods required in the parent Collection
interface.
