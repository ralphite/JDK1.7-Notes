Most methods are aliases of methods from the *StrictMath* class

- interesting methods
    - double sqrt(double) which takes a double and returns a double
    - double cbrt(double) - cube root
    - double ceil(double)
    - double floor(double)
    - static double pow(double, double)
    - double random() - gets a random double value
    
> note how floats and doubles are represented in Java

- more 'non-insane' useful methods :p
    - abs, min and max overloaded for diff primitive types
