##java.util.LinkedHashMap.java.md
----------

Hash table and linked list implementation of the `Map` interface, with predictable iteration order.

A doubly-linked list is maintained running thru all of the entries. The iteration order is normally the insertion order. Note the order is not affected when the key is re-inserted.
