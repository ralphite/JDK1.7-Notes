##java.util.AbstractCollection.java.md
----------

a skeletal implementation of the Collection interface to minimize
the effort required to implement this interface

almost all the methods implemented here use iterators and will be
overridden in subclasses

>>>>need to discuss with others to fully understand iterators here 
and read this class again
